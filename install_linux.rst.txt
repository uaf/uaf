Installation procedure for Linux
====================================================================================================



1. Install the dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use your package manager to install:

  - CMake
  - OpenSSL
  - LibXML2
  - SWIG
  - Python

  You may need to install "devel" packages (``openssl-devel`` and ``libxml2-devel`` in particular), 
  and if you're running a 64-bit operating system you may need to install the appropriate 32-bit
  packages.



2. Install the Unified Automation C++ SDK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Get the C++ SDK from [Unified Automation](http://www.unified-automation.com)
  and install it, for instance, in ``/opt/unifiedautomation``.



3. Generate the make files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If the Unified Automation SDK is installed in /opt, the following just might work::

      cd build
      cmake ../src
  
  **WARNING**: since the SDK v1.4, the SDK (and therefore also the Stack) and the UAF 
  can be built *with* or *without* HTTPS support. The SDK and the UAF must *always* agree 
  on this (so they must both be compiled *with* HTTPS support, or both be compiled *without* 
  HTTPS support). If the SDK and the UAF disagree, your applications may become unreliable.
  
  By default, the SDK that is shipped with the binary SDK versions (such as the free 
  "evaluation" version of the SDK) is compiled *with* HTTPS support. Since the UAF is also 
  compiled by default *with* HTTPS support, you can safely ignore this warning if you use a 
  precompiled Stack/SDK.
  
  However, if you built the SDK yourself (e.g. because you bought the Source License of the
  SDK), it is likely that the Stack will have been compiled *without* HTTPS support. 
  To verify this, you can read the output in the console when you build the SDK: 
  is ``UASTACK_WITH_HTTPS`` indeed OFF? If the SDK was indeed built *without* HTTPS support,
  you must compile the UAF also *without* HTTPS support, like this::

      cmake ..\src -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=OFF
  
  Of course, you can also choose to compile both the SDK and the UAF *with* HTTPS support, 
  by adding ``-DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON`` to the SDK build scripts.


- If needed, you may also specify the path to the Unified Automation SDK explicitly, 
  for instance::

      cd build
      cmake ../src -DUASDK=/path/to/sdk -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON # or OFF


- If needed, you may also use an easy (dirty!) hack to make sure CMake can find the SDK, 
  by creating a symlink in your home directory::
 
      cd build
      ln -s /some/path/to/the/SDK ~/.UaSdk
      cmake ../src -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON # or OFF


- If needed, you may also specify other paths by setting the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` 
  variable, for instance::

      export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/software/Python-2.5.1:/software/Python-2.5.1/include/python2.5
      cd build
      cmake ../src -DUASDK=/path/to/sdk -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON # or OFF


- If needed, you could also specify paths explicitly for your "special" configuration, e.g.::
 
      cmake ../src/ -DUASDK=/software/unifiedautomation/sdk/ \
                    -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/software/python/lib \
                    -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/software/python/include \
                    -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON # or OFF


- If you're building the UAF on a 64-bit platform but you're using the 32-bit 
  Unified Automation SDK libraries, you may want to use ``-DFORCE32`` to force the compiler 
  to create 32-bit libraries, and to force the linker to search for 32-bit OpenSSL libraries::

      cmake ../src -DUASDK=/path/to/sdk -DFORCE32 -DUASTACK_WITH_HTTPS=ON # or OFF


  In this case, also note that you need to install 32-bit Python and 32-bit Python libraries
  in order to make use of the Python wrappers. Of course, the best way to avoid all these 
  annoyances, is to buy the SDK source-code license from Unified Automation and simply 
  compile the SDK in 64-bit (simply by executing the buildSdk64.sh script included with 
  the SDK) for your platform.



4. Build the framework
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Inside the ``build`` folder, run ``make``::
   
      make
   
  If the linker complains about libraries that it cannot find, then make sure the 
  libraries are installed. If the libraries are installed but the linker cannot 
  find them, you may have to create some symbolic links, for instance::
       
      ln -s /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0 /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so


- You can now start to develop your applications:

  - Add the ``lib`` directory of the UAF to your ``$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``$PYTHONPATH``.
  
  - You can now simply start the Python interpreter, and enter ``import pyuaf``.
    No exceptions should be raised.
  
  - If you notice errors then:
    - Verify if ``echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``echo $PYTHONPATH`` indeed point to the ``lib`` 
      directory of the UAF.
    - Verify if the Stack and the UAF were both built *with* (or both built *without*) HTTPS 
      support (see point 3.).
    - If you're still in trouble, send an e-mail or open an issue on the GitHub page! 


5. (OPTIONAL) Build and run the C++ examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Go to the ``examples`` folder, update the ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` (the ``uaf.rc`` 
  script will do that for you), generate the make-files with CMake, and build the examples::
       
      cd examples/
      source uaf.rc
      cd uaf/build
      cmake ../src
      make
       

- Run the examples::
       
      cd ../bin
      simplest_client_example
  
  
- **Note** that some of the examples require that you start the Unified Automation 
  demo server (uaservercpp) on the local machine. The UAServerCPP was already installed 
  when you installed the SDK: you can find the ``uaservercpp`` executable in the ``bin`` 
  directory of the SDK installation directory, e.g.::
       
      /opt/unifiedautomation/sdk/bin/uaservercpp



6. (OPTIONAL) Run the Python examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Go to the ``examples`` folder, update the ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` 
  (the ``uaf.rc`` script will do that for you), and run the examples::
      
      cd examples/pyuaf
      source uaf.rc
      cd client
      python simplest_client_example.py
