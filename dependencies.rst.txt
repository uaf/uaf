Dependencies
============

To build the UAF C++ libraries, you'll need:

 * The [OPC UA C++ SDK of Unified Automation](http://www.unified-automation.com)
   (any version will do: the binary version, the source code version, and the free demo version).
   Currently only the Client SDK is needed, as only the client-side of the UAF is implemented.
   The goal is to also develop the server-side of the UAF, which will obviously require
   the Server SDK. Only if you need both (UAF client-side + UAF server-side), you will need to
   obtain the full SDK (client + server). If just need one side, you will be able to only compile
   that side of the UAF, thereby only requiring the corresponding SDK.
 * OpenSSL
   (will most likely be installed already when you installed the Unified Automation SDK)
 * CMake, the cross-platform build system
 * C++ compiler: GCC for Linux, and Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows (Express version will do)

If you also want to build the Python wrappers, you additionally need:

 * Python
 * SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

Finally, if you want to

 * generate the C++ documentation, you'll also need Doxygen
 * generate the Python documentation, you'll also need Sphinx
 * run the unit tests, you'll need at least Python 2.7
