        Override this method if you want to handle an untrusted certificate.

        This method is called by the UAF whenever an untrusted (e.g. unknown) server certificate
        must be checked at the application level (as part of the connection step, before a
        communication channel is established). Note that this has nothing to do with signed or
        encrypted communication! Even if you don't want to connect to a secured endpoint,
        you're advised to verify the certificate of the server to make sure you're talking to
        the right one.

        It will **not** be called however when you registered a callback function via
        :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.registerUntrustedServerCertificateCallback`.
        So you must choose how to handle untrusted server certificates:
        - either by overriding :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.untrustedServerCertificateReceived`
        - or by registering a callback via  :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.registerUntrustedServerCertificateCallback`.

        This method will be called by the UAF, so you must override it. It is called by
        the UAF whenever it thinks that it should verify the certificate of the server
        (i.e. during (re)connection).

        Typically, during the first connection to a server, the certificate of the server is
        not known to the client yet. By overriding this method, you can therefore show the
        certificate to the user of your software, and ask him/her whether or not
        he/she thinks the certificate can be trusted.

        Three options are available:

        - :attr:`~pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_Reject`: don't trust the certificate, and
          therefore don't try to connect.
        - :attr:`~pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_AcceptTemporarily`: trust the certificate
          temporarily, i.e. don't store it in the trust list but just -for now- allow connection
          to the server. If the UAF must reconnect at some point to the server and the server
          certificate must be checked again, the user shall again have to confirm the certificate.
        - :attr:`~pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_AcceptPermanently`: store the certificate
          in the trust list (as defined by the
          :attr:`~pyuaf.client.settings.ClientSettings.certificateTrustListLocation`: setting) and
          accept the connection. Since the certificate is stored on disk in the trust list,
          the client application will automatically trust the certificate in the future (until
          the certificate expires, of course).

        .. warning::

            You must **always** return one of the following integers:

            - :attr:`pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_Reject`
            - :attr:`pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_AcceptTemporarily`
            - :attr:`pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_AcceptPermanently`

        .. warning::

            By default, :attr:`~pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate.Action_AcceptTemporarily` is returned,
            which means that all untrusted certificates will be **accepted** by default!
            Admittingly that doesn't sound very safe, but it simply implies that by default
            a pyuaf Client will be able to connect to any (unknown) server without needing to
            override this method. If you don't trust the servers in your network, you should
            override this method.

       Create a session manually (instead of having the UAF do it behind the scenes).

       One of the advantages of the UAF is that you can just define the addresses of some nodes, and
       then read/write/monitor/... them without worrying about the technical concerns such as
       session creation, subscription creation etc. So you don't have to create sessions
       yourself, because the UAF will do it for you.
       However, if you want to "keep control" over the session/subscription/... management
       yourself, you can use methods like
       :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.manuallyConnect`,
       :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.manuallyDisconnect`,
       :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.manuallySubscribe`, etc.
       In this case, you can create the sessions/subscriptions/...
       in advance, and then afterwards read/write/... variables by using the same sessions
       and subscriptions. So these "manual" methods allow you to use OPC UA in the "traditional
       way", however it's much easier to do it the "UAF way" and simply forget about the
       creation and deletion of sessions, subscriptions, and monitored items.

       The URL(s) needed to discover the server with the given server URI, can be specified
       via the :class:`~pyuaf.client.settings.ClientSettings` (which you can set via
       :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client` and via :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.setClientSettings`).

           If the connection fails (e.g. because you specified a wrong server URI, or because
           the security settings were incorrect), this methd will *not* raise an Exception!
           It will simply return the ClientConnectionId assigned to the internal Session object,
           which the UAF will try to reconnect in the background! So if you want to make sure
           this method call resulted in a connected session, you should do something like this::

        Manually connect to a specific endpoint, without using the discovery services.

        A UAF client normally uses the discovery process to identify a server and connect to it.
        The user therefore doesn't have to worry about connecting, disconnecting, session management, etc.

        However, in certain cases you may want to connect manually to a specific endpoint, without using
        the discovery process (i.e. without relying on the discovery endpoint of the server).
        In these cases you can use this method.

        You should probably only use this method if you have a good reason not to rely on
        the discovery services provided by the server. A server should be identified by
        a serverURI, not by an endpointURL!

        The :attr:`~pyuaf.client.settings.SessionSettings.securitySettings` attribute of the
        sessionSettings argument (in other words: sessionSettings.securitySettings) defines
        how you want to connect to the server.

        This default instance has
         - no security policy (:attr:`pyuaf.util.securitypolicies.UA_None`)
         - no security mode (:attr:`pyuaf.util.messagesecuritymodes.Mode_None`)
         - no authentication (:attr:`pyuaf.util.usertokentypes.Anonymous`)

        Compliant to OPC UA specs, the serverCertificate will:

        - first be checked at the application level. If it's not valid or not found in the trust
          list, then the untrustedServerCertificateReceived() callback function will be called.
          Override this method if you want to handle those cases.
        - then it may be used for encryption and/or signing (if a secure connection is needed,
          of course).

        You can leave serverCertificate ``None`` (or provide a default, invalid, null
        :class:`~pyuaf.util.PkiCertificate` instance) if you trust the server (i.e. if you make sure
        :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.untrustedServerCertificateReceived`

            The callbacks will run in a separate thread, and therefore any exception they

        For full flexibility, use that function.

        Asynchronous communication can be handled in two ways:
         - you specify a callback function (a function with one argument). This function
           will be called by the UAF when the asynchronous result is received. The argument of this
           function call will be of type :class:`~pyuaf.client.results.WriteResult`.
         - you leave the 'callback' argument None. In this case, your client application need to
           inherit from the :class:`~pyuaf.client.Client` class, so it can override the
           :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.writeComplete` method.

        .. warning::

            Asynchronous requests MUST be invoked on a single session. Meaning:
            the targets of asynchronous requests MUST belong to the same server (as the UAF can
            currently not reconstruct an asynchronous request that must be "split up" to be called
            on multiple servers). If they don't belong to the same server, an error will be raised.

        .. warning::

            The callbacks will run in a separate thread, and therefore any exception they
            raise will *not* be handled or propagated. So your callbacks should have a try-except
            clause if you want to be able to properly handle the exceptions that they may raise.

                                   made some mistake in the time interval!

                                   a "continuation request" for you (if that's needed to fetch
                                   all results)? E.g. if you specify maxAutoReadMore = 10,
                                   then the UAF will automatically perform subsequent
                                   history requests, until either all results are fetched, or
                                   until 10 additional requests have been invoked
                                   automatically.
                                   This parameter will always be used instead of the

                                   requests will be invoked by the UAF (so if you leave this

        Set the publishing mode, by specifying a subscription handle.

        :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.createMonitoredEvents`, it can happen that the server that
        hosts the monitored items is not on-line yet. In this case, the ClientSubscriptionHandle
        is *not* assigned yet, but ClientHandles *are* assigned yet. Therefore it makes sense to
        first call :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.monitoredItemInformation` of your monitored item,

        This is the preferred way to temporarily stop receiving notifications for certain monitored
        items (e.g. because a tab in a User Interface is not visible). See the example below.

        Note that clientHandles instead of MonitoredItemIds are used to identify a monitored item.
        ClientHandles are assigned by the client and are therefore *static*, while MonitoredItemIds
        are assigned by the server, so they may change over time (e.g. after restarting the server,
        of after failover to a redundant server). The UAF will keep track of the mapping between
        both. This means that your monitored items are always identified in the same way (by their
        clientHandles), no matter what happens on the server-side. The UAF takes care of the
        conversion automatically, so you don't have to worry about it.

           the :meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.readComplete`/:meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.writeComplete`/:meth:`~pyuaf.client.Client.dataChangesReceived`/... functions

           In this case, the ReadResult/WriteResult/MethodCallResult/...

           CreateMonitoredEventsRequests, AsyncCreateMonitoredDataRequests and

            Both :class:`~pyuaf.client.requests.CreateMonitoredDataRequest` and
            :class:`~pyuaf.client.requests.CreateMonitoredEventsRequest` are "persistent" requests.
            It means that even when communication fails (e.g. because the server was not online),
            a handle is already assigned to each monitored item as soon as you call processRequest().
            In the background, the UAF will try to (re)establish the connection, and as soon as this
            is successful, it will create the monitored items for you on the server.
            From that point on, you may start to receive notifications (that can be identified by the
            handles that were already assigned and returned to you now).
            So when processRequest() fails, you need to be aware that in the background the UAF
            will retry to create them on the server. You can access the handles that will identify
            their notifications:

             - via the returned :class:`~pyuaf.client.results.CreateMonitoredDataResult` (or
               :class:`~pyuaf.client.results.CreateMonitoredEventsResult`), in case
               processRequest() was successful and didn't raise an exception
             - via the :class:`~pyuaf.util.errors.CreateMonitoredItemsError` exception that was
               raised in case processRequest() was not successful.
               This exception has a
               :attr:`~pyuaf.util.errors.CreateMonitoredItemsError.assignedClientHandles`
               attribute, providing the assigned client handles.

        .. warning::
            Asynchronous requests MUST be invoked on a single session. Meaning:
            the targets of asynchronous requests MUST belong to the same server (as the UAF can
            currently not reconstruct an asynchronous request that must be "split up" to be called
            on multiple servers). If they don't belong to the same server, an error will be raised.

        .. warning::

            The callbacks will run in a separate thread, and therefore any exception they
            raise will *not* be handled or propagated. So your callbacks should have a try-except
