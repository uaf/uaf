Description : This project fills the absence of stdint.h and inttypes.h
              in Microsoft Visual Studio. This files were standartized
              by ISO/IEC as a part of C99 standard library. If you want
              to compile or use C99 compliant project with Microsoft
              Visual Studio, you will likely find that you're missing
              these headers. Note though, that just adding these header
              does not make Visual Studio compiler fully C99 compliant.
